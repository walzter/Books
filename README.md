This is a repository for the books, tutorials, guides,papers and other resources that I will be reading during my winter vacation after the first semester of the Master of Artificial Intelligence at UPC. 

So far the books are: 

- Getting sht done with PyTorch (145 pages) 
- One-shot learning with PyTorch (179 pages)
- AI Fundamentals (191 pages) 
- DL Best Practices (222 pages) 
- Computer Vision Cookbook (355 pages) 
- Python Deep Learning (379 pages) 
- Deep Learning: Fastai + PyTorch (1028 pages) 

=> Total of 2,499 pages for the 3 week vacation. 

Let's see how far I can go! 

This would be like a mini prep-course, because not only will the books be read but other courses such as CS2XX will be taken from online classes as well as Coursera courses. This is just for fun and be able to have a more in-depth knowledge of the PyTorch framework and more Deep Learning fundamentals!
