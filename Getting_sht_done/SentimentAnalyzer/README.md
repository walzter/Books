# This is the readme for the Sentiment Analyzer using BERT and FastAPI

# The model state has not been included because it is heavy. 

# the process goes like this: 

1. Start the server with the following command: 

uvicorn SentimentAnalyzer.api:app

2. You can use the test.ipynb in order to test the model out. 

3. You can also use the script bert_test_curl.py in order to check a given sentence. Here the script will ask you for a sentence as input.
